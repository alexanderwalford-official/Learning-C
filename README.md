# Learning-C
In this repo I'll be learning how to write in pure C.

## Why are you learning basic C?
Even though I have a large deal of experience in writing C#, I've found limitations when using the language and wanted to expand my skillset. Therefore, I'm learning the basic C language so that I can develop closed to machiene level code in a somewhat simple fashion.
